# 1.py

A program which generates two messages m1, m2 where m1 and m2 have the same hash value, m2 is a clean message and m1 is a malicious message. Since there is no clear way to define a clean and a malicious message, any pair (m1, m2) would be accepted as long as they both are valid english sentences and, m1 and m2 have different meaning.
